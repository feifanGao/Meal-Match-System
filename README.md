## README
Our MealMatch system is built for individual clients inexperienced with recipes, especially during the pandemic. The system will suggest a set of recipes based on the preferred ingredients input by users. Some users with cooking experiences called recipe contributors are also able to upload their own recipes to our system so that the other users are able to access. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients which belong to various categories. The system also allows recipe contributors to tag their input recipes with a specific meal type. Additionally, our system also come with suggestion systems both for explorers and contributors. The system could provide suggestions about the other ingredients according to previous input ingredients. For the contributor, our system is designed for suggesting types of category of input ingredients. Through the collections of input data, our system could inform contributors of combinations of ingredients which people prefer but not be contributed with recipes previously through data processing.
